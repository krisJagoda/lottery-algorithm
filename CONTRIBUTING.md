# CONTRIBUTING

- Find an open task in the **Issues** tab
- Add a comment to the task, so others don't take the same task.
- Fork this project in GitHub
- Clone **your** forked repository to your local environment.
- Once you finished your implementation, create a pull request to this repository.
- If there are comments or requested changes by the author, you have to discuss them (defend your point in case of conflicting opinions).
- Implement the proposed changes and push new commits to the PR.
- Once everything is reviewed, the author merges to `main` and closes the task.

## Requirements

- Implement what is requested in the task.
- Make sure your code **runs** and don't break anything. I will check locally sometimes, but I will rely on your ability of being a good dev not to break this codebase.
- Discuss implementation with the author through PR comments.
- Unit testing: Since this is an academic project, not intended to serve as any dependency to a another project, it is ok not to have a good test coverage, however, unit testing can make things easier, like finding bugs in your implementation. I recommend doing testing on the "happy path", if you want to cover corner cases, that is on you.

### If you have something to suggest, message the author on Twitter (link in the README.md)
